        <h1>An Analysis of Baseball Salary and Player Effectiveness</h1>
        <h4>This is the essay explaining the structure and content of the <a href="report.html">narrative visualization</a>.</h4>

        <h2>Messaging</h2>
        The intent of my narrative visualization was to walk the reader through an analysis of professional baseball salaries.
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <h2>Narrative Structure</h2>
        <p>The structure I choose to tell this story more closely resembles an interactive slide show.  The textual content and charts
          are tied together with initial defaults that tie together--examples using Cubs, Whitesox; or Cubs, and the Angels, for example--but 
          the user is encouraged to try the charts out and find supporting or counter evidence.
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <h2>Visual Structure</h2>
        <p>I choose to use a few different elements to ensure continuity and understanding from the reader.  The first, all but the last chart
          uses the same x-axis, mainly the year of play.  Second, whenever there are options to compare team's side-by-side, I used consistent
          colors to show the left-selection vs. the right-selection.  Third, transitions are used where it made sense to help the user understand
          what exactly was changing when different selections were made.
        </p>
      </div>
        
      <div class="Row">
        <h2>Scenes</h2>
        <p>There are four main scenes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Consumer Product Index (CPI) vs. Aggregate Baseball Salaries.<p></p>This secenes sets 
            the stage for the entire visualization by establishing how much faster than inflation
          these sports players salaries are.   Currently it is a more or less a static display, through
          I suppose it could also by implemented to be consistent with the visualizaiton schemes below...</p>

          <li>Player performance (per salary) over time.<p>This is used to establish evidence that player's performance
            is not rising consummate with their income.  TODO add annotation for this--maybe trendline?</p>
          </li>

          <li>Best-Player performance (per salary) over time.  <p>This is used to test the conjencture that averaging a team's
            washed out any signal. Spoiler: it doesn't.  </li>

          <li>Finally, Performance by Tenure. <p>This is used to highlight the effect of salary controls on rookie players and to
            explain some abnormalities seen in the prior scene</p>
        </ul>

        <p>The order displayed is very intentional.  The first scene (CPI) sets the stage for the remainder--salaries are absurd.  The second scene
          dives into a natural place to start looking into "why?".  There are many other places we could have started--team revenue, ticket sales, ad revenue,
          merchandise sales, etc. But baseball affecienados only care about one thing.  Performance!  Having seen a contrary trend, the next two scenes further
          dive into two conjenctures the reader is likely to form themselves--why are teams seemingly getting worse? and why do rookies show up so well?
        </p>        
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <h2>Annotations</h2>
        <p>What template was followed for the annotations, and why that template? How are
          the annotations used to support the messaging? Do the annotations change within a single scene,
          and if so, how and why</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <p> What are the parameters of the narrative visualization? What are the states of the
          narrative visualization? How are the parameters used to define the state and each scene?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <h2>Triggers</h2>
        <p>What are the triggers that connect user actions to changes of state in the narrative
          visualization? What affordances are provided to the user to communicate to them what options are
          available to them in the narrative visualization? </p>
