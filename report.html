                <h1>An Analysis of Baseball Salary and Player Effectiveness</h1>
                <h4>Baseball salaries have been outpacing inflation year over year since data was available.  Is player performance keeping pace?</h4>

                <p><em>These pages are part of rdb4@illinois.edu / rdbisch@gmail.com project for CS498 Data Visualization.</em></p>
                
                <p>This narrative visualization is based on the <a href="http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/">2019 Lahman Baseball database</a>
                    with a variety of filters applied to simplify the analysis:
                    <ul>
                        <li>We restrict analysis to non-pitchers only as the analysis focuses heavily on batting performance.   In the National Legague, pitchers bat, but are notriously bad at it.  In the American League, pitchers do not bat.</li>
                        <li>We calculate the player's primary position as the position they most often started in.  This may not coincide with their identified position in offical stats.
                        <li>We treat teams that have changed identification over the years as being one in the same.  In particular, California Angels or Los Angelas Angels or Anaheim, are all treated as "Angels".  Similarly for Marlins and Brewers teams.
                        <li>We are only looking at seasons where salary data was readily available, which translates into 1984 and beyond.

            <div class="row">
                <p>Is this dramatic increase justified based on player performance? Are teams getting
                    better talent for the dollar as time goes on? Would they be
                    just as effective without paying for superstar talent?
                </p>

                <p>A statistic called wins-above-replacement, or WAR for short, has emerged in the last few years as an important
                    metric of player performance.  The statistic answers the question "How many wins did an individual player contribute
                    to the team?" by comparing the players performance against any other random player in the league. 
                    
                <p>The modeling of this variable takes into account the players batting performance, fielding performance, and controls
                    for factors like varying pitching ability and field elevation.   

                <p>We will focus our analysis on the batting components of WAR.  In partciular, we will look at on-base percentage
                    relative to average league performance and SLUGing average (number of bases on average per hit) relative to league 
                    performance.  The sum of these statistics, OPS_PLUS, is a major factor in WAR calculations.

                <p>As a gentle introduction, let's consider everyone's favorite team the Chicago Cubs, a team that notriously spends 
                    lots on player's salary, to their rivals from the southside, the Chicago White Sox.

            <div class="row">
                <p>The two teams shown don't display much of an improvement in trend.  In fact with every team we've looked at
                    there is not much of a trend at all.
                    
                <p>Not a very compelling case--certainly not one to justify $2 Billion in salary.

                <p>Still, there might be reasons other than performance to justify these salaries--the popularity
                    of baseball may have been increased, the player's themselves did a better job of negotiation, 
                    or there may be yet more confounds.

                <p>Another potential issue is that, by averaging the entire team's OPS_PLUS, we have washed out the 
                    effect of the best players.   In the chart below, we isolate the highest performing player for 
                    each team, and normalize by their salary.  That is to say, we look at who has the highest AB*OPS_PLUS / Salary
                    on each team, year combination.  If team's are getting better at scouting talent and getting breakout
                    players, it should show up here.

                <p>Performance-per-dollar of the best players are getting worse over time!  

                <p>There is an interesting effect happening in the default example displayed, and you can see it in other team selections two.  Baseball
                    has strutured their salary program such that rookies are insanely cheap for what they produce.  Compare Kris Bryant's 2016 season to Mike Trouts.

                <p>Bryant looks like a rock-star, and he is to be sure.  But is he better than Trout?  Not when you look at the numbers--Trout had a full 21 more points in OPS_PLUS.
                    Is that worth $10 million more than Bryant? No.  Bryant is paid so little because baseball pays rookies so little until they enter free-agency and can renegotiate their contracts.
                    
                <p>You can see this affect pretty dramatically with Mike Trout.  His performance is actually better year over-year, but this affect is dominated by his increasing salary as he entered free-agency.</p>

                        Free-agency is pretty complicated in baseball, as it starts from the day the contract is signed and not when a player starts playing in the majors.  Nonetheless
                                 most major league players are in free-agency anywhere from year 3-6, and we do see
                                 a step decline here in performance per dollar, consistent with significant change
                                 in salary, as opposed to performance.
